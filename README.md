2. Adjust it as a Bezier curve
3. and Export it to TikZ/SVG/JSON!

 **Heritage**
 ---
**Knottingham** was inspired by two cool tools for drawing and identifying knots, namely the [Knot Identification Tool](https://joshuahhh.com/projects/kit/) by Joshua Horowitz and [KnotFolio](https://kmill.github.io/knotfolio/index.html) by Kyle Miller. 
It uses [paper.js](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js) for rendering. Other than this great drawing library, **Knottingham** is vanilla Javascript.

 **In the Future**
 ---
These features are planned:

*   Complete Non-Reidemeister Move-Detection
*   Some more styling options

 **License**
 ---
**Knottingham** is free software and licensed under MIT.
