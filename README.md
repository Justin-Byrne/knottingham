## Knottingham
is a tool that lets you draw and manipulate knot diagrams, sporting a clean yet somewhat hand-drawn look. 
You can:
- Draw a knot from scratch & Have its intersections calculated for you
- Adjust it with Bezier control points
- and Export it to SVG!

### Heritage
**Knottingham** was inspired by two wonderful tools for drawing and identifying knots, namely the [Knot Identification Tool](https://joshuahhh.com/projects/kit/) by Joshua Horowitz and [KnotFolio](https://kmill.github.io/knotfolio/index.html) by Kyle Miller. 
Furthermore, many thanks to [paper.js](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js)! This wouldn't be possible without its powerful features. Other than that, **Knottingham** is vanilla Javascript.

### In the Future
These features are planned:

*   Loading JSON
*   Properly permanent crossing topology
*   Classification of knots through knot invariants (for single knots)
*   Exporting to TikZ
*   Non-Reidemeister Move-Detection
*   Some more styling options
*   Undoing
*   Multiple intertwined knots

Any and all feedback is appreciated! You can mail to [developer/at/fi-le.net](mailto:developer/at/fi-le.net).
